# Mr Martin's JupyterHub

This is your server. You can add and save files, and access class exercises here. 

Each folder under CCSS contains a Jupyter Notebook, with the file extension .ipynb. This has a mix of instructions and code blocks and is where you'll be doing most of your work, so open the .ipynb file first to get started with an exercise.

If you're missing a notebook, click [here](https://mrmartin.uk/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJakeMartin-ICL%2Fccss&urlpath=nteract%2Fedit%2Fccss%2F) to pull any updated or new exercises.

This server is running on my computer at home, so while you're free to access it outside of class, I can't guarantee that it will be up 24/7.

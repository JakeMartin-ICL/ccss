# Mr Martin's JupyterHub

This is your server. You can add and save files, and access class exercises here.

If you're missing a notebook, click [here](https://mrmartin.uk/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJakeMartin-ICL%2Fccss&urlpath=tree%2Fccss%2F) to pull any updated or new exercises.

This server is running on my computer at home, so while you're free to access it outside of class, I can't guarantee that it will be up 24/7.

    "This notebook is to help get you started with the basics of practical programming, and once completed you can use it as a reference for future exercises. Being able to program is an important skill, teaching you how to break down a problem while getting instant feedback so you can correct your mistakes. Follow the instructions carefully, try to understand what each line is doing, and ask me if you have any questions. Don't worry (or even be surprised) if your code doesn't work initially, I'm always very surprised when my own code works first time. Read the error message to try and figure out why it didn't work and correct it. Also, each concept probably appears later in the notebook, it's not cheating to look ahead if you need help with the structure!\n",
